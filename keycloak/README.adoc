= Keycloak

This folder contains the necessary setup to run https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/[Keycloak Docker image] to provide an OAuth2 Authorization server.
Running https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] is not necessary until the spring-flights application is secured using JWTs.

== Setup

To run the sample, ensure you have https://docs.docker.com/install/[docker installed].

TIP: If you are using Ubuntu, you can use `./ubuntu-install-docker.sh`

== Running the Keycloak Docker Image

* Once docker is installed, you can run `./keycloak.sh` which will start keycloak container and make keycloak available on port `9999`.
* Start up the applications
* You can login with the `username`/``password``s:
** `user` and the password `password`.
